# Kappital Open Governance

The governance model adopted here is heavily influenced by a set of CNCF projects, especially drew
reference from [Kubernetes governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md).
*For similar structures some of the same wordings from kubernetes governance are borrowed to adhere
to the originally construed meaning.*

  and alignment with project objectives, scope and design principles.
